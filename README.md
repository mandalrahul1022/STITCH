## 🔬 What This Project Does

STITCH treats **malware lateral movement** and **biological epidemic spread** as the **same mathematical process**: stochastic diffusion on power-law contact graphs. It builds a complete research pipeline from first principles:

```
Spectral Theory  →  Monte Carlo Sensitivity  →  Tensor Simulation  →  Temporal GNN Prediction
    (Phase 1)            (Phase 2)                  (Phase 3)              (Phase 4)
```

The core insight: if `P(exposure) = 1 − (1 − β)^k` is domain-agnostic, then a model trained on cyber-contagion
learns transferable physics applicable to zoonotic pathogen transmission, ransomware propagation, and any
process governed by stochastic diffusion on networks with power-law degree distributions.

## 🔎 Key Findings

### Finding 1 — The Epidemic is Mathematically Guaranteed Before Tick 0

Before the simulation runs a single step, the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix determines the outcome:

| Metric | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| ρ(A) | 21.96 | Largest eigenvalue via ARPACK Lanczos iteration |
| λ_c = 1/ρ(A) | 0.0455 | Epidemic threshold from spectral graph theory |
| β / λ_c | **8.78×** | Deep supercritical regime at β = 0.40 |

This is not a heuristic. It is a **theorem**: when β > λ_c, the epidemic is guaranteed to reach a macroscopic fraction of nodes. The simulation confirms the prediction: **9,372 / 10,000 nodes (93.7%) infected at peak**, reached at tick 14. The Susceptible population collapses to zero in under 20 ticks despite targeted patching running from tick 0.

![Epidemic Dashboard](epidemic_dashboard.png)

**What the four panels show:**

| Panel | Content |
|---|---|
| **Top-left** | Classic SEIR curve: Susceptible (green) collapses, Infected (red) spikes to 93.7%, Patched (grey) grows slowly. The curve does not flatten. |
| **Top-right** | Hub nodes (purple) ignite the outbreak first. Non-hub nodes (red) carry the bulk. 1,090 hubs exist; patching them buys time but cannot stop the cascade across 8,910 non-hub nodes. |
| **Bottom-left** | Patching queue depth (blue bars) stays shallow; nodes flow through steadily. Cumulative patched (grey line) reaches 1,085 (10.8%) by tick 100. |
| **Bottom-right** | Stacked fate chart: by tick 20 the network is 90%+ infected. It never recovers under β = 0.40. |

---

### Finding 2 — Viral Transmissibility Drives 54.8% of All Outcome Variance

640 Monte Carlo runs with Saltelli quasi-random parameter sampling. Sobol variance decomposition quantifies which parameters determine the epidemic outcome:

![Sobol Sensitivity Indices](sobol_indices.png)

| Parameter | S1 (first-order) | ST (total-order) | S1→ST Gap | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `spread_chance` (β) | 0.437 | **0.548** | 0.111 | Dominant driver. The attacker's weapon. |
| `patching_rate` | 0.211 | **0.390** | **0.179** | Strongest defensive lever. Largest interaction gap. |
| `patch_completion_prob` | 0.035 | 0.166 | 0.131 | Weak alone; gains power through parameter interactions. |
| `rewire_rate` | -0.012 | 0.005 | 0.017 | Statistically irrelevant. Network volatility does not matter. |

**The critical finding is the S1-to-ST gap for `patching_rate` (0.179)**, the largest in the set. This proves patching does not act in isolation: it amplifies or dampens the effect of every other parameter. The defensive value of patching degrades as the virus gets faster. This is a **policy-relevant insight** with direct analogues in public health intervention strategy.

![Parameter Interaction Heatmap](interaction_heatmap.png)

The heatmap confirms: `spread_chance × patching_rate = 0.204` is the strongest off-diagonal interaction. Network rewiring (rightmost column) is uniformly near zero.

### Finding 3 — A Temporal GCN Predicts Infections 5 Ticks Ahead on Unseen Infrastructure

A Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (T-GCN) processes a **4-tick sliding window** of graph state to predict per-node infection status at T+5. The architecture fuses spatial neighbor aggregation (GCNConv) with temporal memory (GRU), encoding **propagation velocity** rather than static snapshots.

**Why temporal matters:** A static GCN sees a photograph. The T-GCN sees a movie. The GRU hidden state accumulates how fast infection is moving through each node's neighborhood over 4 consecutive ticks. By tick T, the representation encodes the *trajectory* of contagion, not just the current snapshot.

```
Architecture: GCNConv(5, 16) → ReLU  [shared across all 4 ticks in window]
              → GRU(16, 16)          [accumulates temporal hidden state]
              → Linear(16, 1)        [per-node infection logit]
              Total: 1,745 parameters
```

**Inductive evaluation protocol:** The model trains on 5 BA graph topologies (seeds 42-46) and is tested on 2 **completely unseen** topologies (seeds 52-53). The test graphs have different hub positions, different edge wiring, and different simulation dynamics. The model cannot memorize the address book of any specific network.

---

### Finding 4 — The Model Retains 97.6% of Ranking Performance Under 85% Telemetry Blackout

**Experimental design:** Both Run A and Run B train on identical clean data with full visibility. The only difference is what the model sees **at evaluation time**. Run B masks 85% of infection states to -1 (sentinel) with a synchronized observability flag set to 0.0 for masked nodes. This is the standard partial-observability protocol: train the best model possible, then stress-test it under degraded conditions.

![GNN Performance](gnn_performance.png)

| Metric | Full Visibility | 85% Masked | Delta | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **AUC-ROC** | **0.873** | **0.852** | **-0.021** | 97.6% of ranking ability preserved. Graph topology carries the signal. |
| Test Accuracy | 64.8% | 53.8% | -11.0% | Threshold-dependent; misleading under 89.2% class imbalance. |
| Hub Recall | 61.5% | 49.0% | -12.5% | Hub prediction degrades more than overall ranking. Hubs are hardest to predict blind. |

> **Note on accuracy:** Raw accuracy appears low because 89.2% of nodes are infected at the test ticks (deep into the epidemic). A naive "predict everyone infected" classifier scores ~89% accuracy while providing zero actionable intelligence. AUC-ROC is the definitive metric because it evaluates ranking quality across all classification thresholds, independent of class imbalance.

**What the -0.021 AUC delta means operationally:**

In a Security Operations Center, you will never have full telemetry. Endpoints go dark. Agents fail silently. Lateral movement happens in network segments you cannot observe. The -0.021 delta proves that on power-law networks, **graph topology and temporal propagation patterns carry almost all of the predictive signal**. The model does not need to see infection status to predict where the contagion is heading. It infers propagation from structure.

In epidemiology, the parallel is exact: most infections are unreported, most hosts are unsampled. A model that retains 97.6% of its ranking performance under 85% surveillance blindness is operationally useful in both domains.

---

## 📐 Mathematical Core

### Vectorized SEIR Transmission

```
infected_neighbors = A · x_infected        (SpMV, COO sparse float32)
P(exposure)        = 1 − (1 − β)^k         (per-node, vectorized, zero Python loops)
```

This transmission kernel is **domain-agnostic**: `β` is a transmission coefficient, `k` is the count of infected neighbors, and `A` defines the contact topology. Whether nodes represent network endpoints or animal hosts, the math is identical.

### Spectral Threshold (Pre-flight Check)

```
ρ(A) = largest eigenvalue of A     [ARPACK Lanczos, never dense]
λ_c  = 1 / ρ(A)                    [epidemic threshold]
β > λ_c  →  pandemic guaranteed     [spectral graph theory theorem]
```

### Phase III Algorithmic Mechanics

| Mechanism | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Async patching queue** | Geometric drain: each queued node completes with prob `p_drain` per tick |
| **Stochastic edge rewiring** | `rewire_rate` fraction of edges randomly reconnected per tick |
| **Latency-weighted exposure** | Queued nodes transmit at 50% rate during repair |

### T-GCN Forward Pass

```
For each tick w in [T-3, T-2, T-1, T]:
    emb_w = ReLU( GCNConv( x_w, edge_index ) )     # spatial aggregation
    _, h  = GRU( emb_w, h )                          # temporal accumulation

logit = Linear( h )                                   # per-node prediction
```

The GRU hidden state `h` carries forward across ticks, encoding the *velocity* of infection propagation through each node's neighborhood. By tick T, `h` contains temporal momentum information that a static snapshot cannot capture.

## 🧬 The Biological Isomorphism

The mathematical framework is domain-agnostic by design. The table below maps every component:

| STITCH Concept | Cybersecurity Domain | Epidemiology Domain |
|---|---|---|
| Node | Network endpoint (server, laptop, IoT device) | Host organism (human, animal, vector) |
| Edge | Network connection (VLAN, subnet link) | Contact event (proximity, bite, aerosol) |
| β (spread_chance) | Exploit success probability | Pathogen transmission coefficient |
| State S → E → I → R | Susceptible → Exposed → Infected → Patched | Susceptible → Exposed → Infectious → Recovered |
| Patching rate | SOC remediation speed | Vaccination or treatment rate |
| Hub node | High-degree server / core switch | Superspreader host |
| ρ(A) | Network spectral radius | Contact network spectral radius |
| 85% masking | Endpoint telemetry blackout | Incomplete epidemiological surveillance |

The T-GCN architecture trained on cyber-contagion learns the **physics of diffusion on power-law graphs**. Replacing the BA adjacency matrix with an empirical host-contact network from USDA or CDC surveillance data makes this a zoonotic pathogen prediction system with no architectural changes.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Future Work

- Single test-seed pair (52, 53); multi-seed stability harness with mean ± std is planned.
- AUC oscillates during training (84.6% → 92.0% → 82.9% → 87.3% across epochs 20-60). A learning rate scheduler or early stopping with best-checkpoint selection would likely push full-visibility AUC above 0.90.
- BA graphs approximate but do not fully capture edge heterogeneity.
- Planned: progressive masking sweep (50-95%), degree-biased/spatial cluster masking, empirical topology replacement with real network or CDC host-contact data.

---

## 📝 Requirements

- Python 3.11+ · all packages in `requirements.txt`
- Runs on CPU (Mac/Linux), NVIDIA CUDA 12+, or Apple MPS (auto-detected)

## Appendix: Legacy Mesa Prototype (No Dashboard)

The original Mesa agent-based model (N=200) remains in `models/university_network.py` as a legacy prototype used early in development. The interactive Mesa dashboard (`server.py`) has been removed to keep the repository focused on the 10,000-node tensor + T-GCN pipeline.
